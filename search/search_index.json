I may even \"advertise\" the blog by posting on Hacker News or Reddit.  </p> <p>But I don\u2019t expect more than the occasional reader. And in a way, I don\u2019t want anything more than that.  </p> <p>First and foremost, I write this blog for myself, and I don\u2019t want to fall into the trap of writing about things that don\u2019t interest me just to attract more eyes.  </p>"},{"location":"posts/why-does-this-blog-exist.html#i-do-not-blog-as-a-personal-portfolio","title":"I Do Not Blog As A Personal Portfolio","text":"<p>Some people advocate for blogging as a way to build a personal portfolio.

But again, that won\u2019t be this blog.  </p> <p>I don\u2019t want to write about things just because they might benefit my career. I want to write about whatever I find interesting.  </p> <p>Most importantly, I don\u2019t want to feel pressured to maintain a \"professional\" writing style.

You don\u2019t know much about the topic yet, but you put in the effort\u2014reading through resources, maybe even listening to someone explain it. And everything makes perfect sense.  </p> <p>Until you try to apply what you\u2019ve learned.  </p> <p>Suddenly, you realize you don\u2019t understand the topic as well as you thought.  </p> <p>This is the difference between passively consuming knowledge and actively applying it.  </p> <p>When you read or listen to something, it\u2019s easy to mistake familiarity for understanding. If you\u2019ve encountered the same information enough times, it feels like you know it. But that feeling is deceptive.  </p> <p>When you think about a concept in your head, your mind glosses over the gaps in your understanding. But when you try to explain it on a blank page, those gaps become painfully obvious.  </p> <p>And that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m doing this. I want to build things that I find cool, and then put them out into the world.
